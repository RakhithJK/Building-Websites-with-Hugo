# 🦹🏽 Project I: A Personal Website

This is a very simple template for a personal website. It's called "Rick Sanchez Homepage" and uses Hugo's theme "hugo-split-theme".

<p align="center">
<img src="./../personal_website.png" width="60%" align="center" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" />
</p>


You can run it locally (`localhost:1313`) with:

```
hugo server -D
```
